# Machine-Learning-by-Hand

I implement some famous machine learning methods by hand.

These methods include:

- Perceptron 
- KNN 
- Naive Bayes 
- Decision Tree 
- SVM 
- AdaBoost 
- Gradient Boosting Tree 
- Random Forest 
- EM Algorithm 
- Hidden Markov Model 
- Clustering 
- Principal Component Analysis 
- Latent Semantic Analysis 
- Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis 
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
- PageRank 

Each model has been put in a folder and in each folder, there exist:

- A pdf file which introduces the theory, implementation by sklearn and implementation by hand
- A Rmd file which can be complied to the pdf file
- Some files which only include codes (like .ipynb,.py,etc.)


I use *Statistical Learning Methods, Second Edition, by Hang Li* as reference.
